Sometimes this feels like
an ending of a movie
If I'm just dreaming,
then I'm hoping
I can stay asleep
Know that no matter what
After the closing scene
I'll be the only one to love you
in my dreams
Sometimes it feels like
I'll never have enough of you
When you're around me,
you make
every passing moment new
And when I'm not with you,
I know you'll still agree
I'll be the only one to love you
in my dreams
Oh my, I swear
I can't stop
looking into those eyes
I'm lost, maybe I'm hypnotized
'Cause the way you look
with these pink skies
As the sun drifts away,
tonight
Just hold tight
'Cause when you're in my arms,
it feels right
You know there ain't no place
I'd rather be
Just dance with me all night
'Cause baby,
nothing else feels like
You, you,
nothing feels like you, you
No, there ain't no place
I'd rather be
Just dance with me all night
'Cause baby,
nothing else feels like you
I got that feeling like
we're young,
and it's a summer fling
But I've been hurt
enough to know
I love you differently
I think I finally found someone
who won't disagree
I'll be the only one
you'll keep loving
in your dreams
Oh my,
I swear I can't stop
looking into those eyes
I'm lost, maybe I'm hypnotized
'Cause the way you look
with these pink skies
As the sun drifts away tonight
Just hold tight
'Cause when you're in my arms
it feels right
You know there ain't no place
I'd rather be
Just dance with me all night
'Cause baby nothing else
feels like
You, you,
nothing feels like you, you
No, there ain't no place
I'd rather be
Just dance with me all night
'Cause baby,
nothing else feels like you
