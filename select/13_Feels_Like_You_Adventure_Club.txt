I still wake up on your pillow in the morning
Liked it better when your head was laying on it
'Stead of mine, 'Stead of mine, 'stead of

Didn't think that every weekend would be so hard
Getting good at making love without the love part
Every night, every night, without you

Wish I didn't know too much
To go back to when I still believed in us

No I don't want, don't want, don't want to
I should let you go but all I really know is
Is I don't want, don't want, don't want someone new
'Cause no one really knows me
Not like in the way you do

It's not your body on mine but
I can't let the memories die
I don't want, don't want someone new
Just someone who feels like you
Just someone who feels like you
Just someone who feels like you

It's not your body on mine but
I can't let the memories die
I don't want, don't want someone new
Just someone who feels like you
Just someone who feels like you
Just someone who feels like you
Just someone who feels like you
Just someone who feels like you

Used to tuck me in the space below your shoulder
Now I close my eyes and pull his body closer
Almost like you and I, almost

Wish I didn't know too much
To go back to when I still believed in us
Someone, who doesn't know my name
Who helps to numb the pain
Who can help me the same

Just someone who feels like you
Someone who feels like you

No I don't want, don't want, don't want to
I should let you go but all I really know
Is I don't want, don't want someone new
'Cause no one really knows me
Not like in the way you do

It's not your body on mine but
I can't let the memories die
I don't want, don't want someone new
Just someone who feels like you
Just someone who feels like you
Just someone who feels like you
Just someone who feels like you
Just someone who feels like you
Just someone who feels like you
